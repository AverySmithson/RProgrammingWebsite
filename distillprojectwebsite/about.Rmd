  This website is meant to serve as a intro guide for anyone wanting to learn the basics about how programming in R works (specifically for statsitical purposes). Once you have these basics down, I hope it will help you to be more confident in learning how to do more advanced things using R. All the data I use comes from Our World in Data, specifially the mental health data. I was able to find and use a package to bring this data into R to make that process a little bit easier. 
  
  I hope you find my tips about R useful!
